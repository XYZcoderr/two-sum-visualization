## Introduction

The TwoSumVisualization component is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the Two Sum algorithm. It allows users to input arrays and target values, visualize each step of the algorithm, and see how the solution is derived using a hash map.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step visual representation of the Two Sum algorithm.
- **Custom Test Cases**: Add and visualize your own test cases.
- **Predefined Test Cases**: Run predefined test cases to see different scenarios.
- **Play/Pause Control**: Automate the visualization process or step through it manually.
- **Detailed Step Information**: View the current state of the array, hash map, and complement calculations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TwoSumVisualization.git
    cd TwoSumVisualization
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Input Array and Target**: Use the input fields to specify your own array and target value.
2. **Run Test Cases**: Click on predefined test cases to visualize them.
3. **Add Custom Test Case**: Enter a comma-separated array and target value to add your own test case.
4. **Control Visualization**: Use the play, pause, step forward, step backward, and reset buttons to control the visualization process.

## Customization

You can customize the visualization by editing the state and styles within the `TwoSumVisualization` component:

- **State Variables**: Adjust the initial values of the state variables to change the default array and target.
- **Styles**: Modify the CSS classes or add new styles to customize the appearance of the visualization.
